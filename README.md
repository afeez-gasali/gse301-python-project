# gse301-python-project
Student Academic Performance Analysis System built with Python for GSE301. Demonstrates core Python concepts including data structures, control flow, match-case, error handling, and an interactive menu system

## Features
This project demonstrates Python fundamentals including:
- Data structures (list, set, tuple, dictionary)
- Conditional statements
- Match-case
- Error handling
- List slicing
- Set operations
- Logical operators

## Biggest Challenge
- Understanding the differences between list indexing and dictionary key access, which initially caused errors when accessing student names.
- Debugging issues caused by Python's case senditivity (e.g., using `Input()` instead of `input()`).
- Implementing `lambda` functions for the first time when identifying the top performance.

These challenges improved my understanding of Python syntax and data structures concepts.

## Sample Output
Screenshots of the program running successfully are included in the `screenshots/` folder.
